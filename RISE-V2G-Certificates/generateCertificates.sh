# This shell script can be used to create all necessary certificates and keystores needed in order to
# - successfully perform a TLS handshake between the EVCC (TLSClient) and the SECC (TLSServer) and 
# - install/update a contract certificate in the EVCC.
# Previously created certificates should have been provided with the respective release of the RISE V2G project for testing purposes. However, certain certificates might not be valid any more in which case you need to create new certificates. 
# This file shall serve you with all information needed to create your own certificate chains.
#
# Helpful information about using openssl is provided by Ivan Ristic's book "Bulletproof SSL and TLS".
# Furthermore, you should have openssl 1.0.2 (or above) installed to comply with all security requirements imposed by ISO 15118. For example, openssl 0.9.8 does not come with SHA-2 for SHA-256 signature algorithms. Some MacOS X installations unfortunately still use openssl < v1.0.2. You could use Homebrew to install openssl. Be aware that you probably then need to use an absolute path for your openssl commands, such as /usr/local/Cellar/openssl/1.0.2h_1/bin/openssl.
