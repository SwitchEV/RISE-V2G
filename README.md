### About RISE V2G

RISE V2G is the **R**eference **I**mplementation **S**upporting the **E**volution of the **V**ehicle-**2**-**G**rid communication interface ISO 15118.
The international standard ISO 15118, entitled "Road vehicles - Vehicle to grid communication interface", defines a digital IP-based communication interface between an electric vehicle (EV) and a charging station (named Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment - EVSE). It allows for a user-friendly "Plug And Charge" mechanism for authentication, authorisation, billing, and flexible load control based on a wide set of information exchanged between the EV and EVSE.
A rise in the wide application of this standard is essential for reaching the goal of integrating EVs as flexible energy storage devices into a smart grid.


### Support Update
