# Network interface
#------------------
# 
# The network interface name like en3 or eth1 of the network interface on which to communicate with the SECC via a 
# link-local IPv6 address
network.interface = en0


# Security
#---------
#
# Possible values: 
# - true
# - false
# If this value is set to 'false', TCP will be used on transport layer
# If no correct value is provided here, 'false' will be chosen
tls = false


# Contract certificate update time span
#-------------------------------------
#
# Integer value defining the time span in days which precedes the expiration of a contract certificate 
# and during which an update of the contract certificate needs to be performed
contract.certificate.update.timespan = 14


# SessionID
#----------
#
# If this value is unequal to zero, then it represents a previously 
# paused V2G communication session
session.id = 0


# Selected payment option
#------------------------
#
# This (single!) value needs to be provided from a previous charging session if charging has been paused.
# Possible values are:
# - Contract 
# - ExternalPayment
authentication.mode = 


# Requested energy transfer mode
#--------------------------------
#
# This (single!) value needs to be provided from a previous charging session if charging has been paused.
# Possible values are:
# - AC_single_phase_core
# - AC_three_phase_core
# - DC_core
# - DC_extended
# - DC_combo_core
# - DC_unique
energy.transfermode.requested = AC_three_phase_core


# XML representation of messages
#-------------------------------
#
# Possible values: 
# - true
# - false
# If this value is set to 'true', the EXICodec will print each message's XML representation (for debugging purposes) 
# If no correct value is provided here, 'false' will be chosen
exi.messages.showxml = true


# Hexadecimal and Base64 representation of messages
#--------------------------------------------------
#
# Possible values: 
# - true
# - false
# If this value is set to 'true', the EXICodec will print each message's hexadecimal and Base64 representation (for debugging purposes) 
# If no correct value is provided here, 'false' will be chosen
exi.messages.showhex = true


# Extended logging of signature verification
#-------------------------------------------
#
# Possible values: 
# - true
# - false
# If this value is set to 'true', extended logging will be printed upon verification of signatures (for debugging purposes) 
# If no correct value is provided here, 'false' will be chosen
signature.verification.showlog = true


# EXI codec
#--------------------------------
#
# This (single!) value tells the program which EXI codec to use to en-/decode EXI messages
# Possible values are:
# - exificient
# - open_exi
# If no correct value is provided here, 'exificient' will be used
exi.codec = exificient


# Voltage accuracy
#----------
#
# Used for the PreCharge target voltage. The present voltage indicated by the charging station in PreChargeRes can deviate from the present voltage 
# set in PreChargeReq by an EV-specific deviation factor. This value is given in percent.
# Example: voltage.accuracy = 10 means: present voltage may deviate from target voltage by 10 percent in order to successfully stop PreCharge
voltage.accuracy = 5
