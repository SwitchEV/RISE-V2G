#----------
#
# If this value is unequal to zero, then it represents a previously 
# paused V2G communication session

# Selected payment option
#------------------------
#
# This (single!) value needs to be provided from a previous charging session if charging has been paused.
# Possible values are:
# - Contract 
# - ExternalPayment

# Requested energy transfer mode
#--------------------------------
#
# This (single!) value needs to be provided from a previous charging session if charging has been paused.
